# Motivation
Inspired from the Korean Drama [Strongest Deliveryman](https://www.dramafever.com/drama/5059/Strongest_Deliveryman/), 
where the main girl uses this app to keep track of the days remaining until 
she can emigrate to the states and live a comfortable life there. The goal 
of this app is to replicate it while using the very nice text input effects 
from [this article.](https://tympanus.net/codrops/2015/01/08/inspiration-text-input-effects/)

# Usage
1. clone repo
2. npm start
3. scan qr with the expo app
